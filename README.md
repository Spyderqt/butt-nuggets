# Chickens for Community: Building Connections in Humphreys County

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Chickens for Community** project! This initiative aims to utilize chickens as a unique way to foster a sense of community, promote sustainable living, and support local agriculture in Humphreys County. By integrating chickens into community spaces, we hope to create opportunities for education, collaboration, and social engagement among residents.

## Objectives

- **Educational Opportunities**: Provide educational resources and workshops on poultry care, sustainable farming, and environmental stewardship.
- **Support Local Agriculture**: Boost local food production and self-sufficiency by encouraging backyard and community poultry farming.
- **Foster Social Connections**: Use chicken-keeping as a catalyst for bringing people together, sharing experiences, and building stronger neighborhood bonds.

## Project Activities
1. **Community Chicken Coops**: Establish communal chicken coops in local parks and community centers where residents can collaboratively care for the chickens.
2. **Educational Workshops**: Host regular workshops on topics such as chicken care, coop building, egg collection, and sustainable agriculture practices.
3. **Chicken Adoption Program**: Launch a program where families and individuals can adopt chickens, with support and guidance provided by the project team.
4. **Farm-to-Table Events**: Organize events that highlight the benefits of local food production, featuring dishes made with eggs and produce from community chickens.
